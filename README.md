TwistPy is a small open-source Python package for seismic data processing. It includes routines for single-station polarization
analysis and filtering, as well as array processing tools.

A special focus lies on innovative techniques to process spatial wavefield gradient data and, in particular, rotational
seismic data obtained from dedicated rotational seismometers or small-aperture arrays of three-component sensors.

Some of the tools available in TwistPy are:

- Three-component polarization analysis and filtering (both time domain and S-transform).
- Six-component polarization analysis and filtering (both time domain and S-transform).
- Six-component wave type fingerprinting.
- Single-station six-component Love- and Rayleigh-wave dispersion and Rayleigh wave ellipticity angle estimation.
- Dynamic tilt corrections for seismometers using direct rotation measurements.
- Beamforming (Bartlett, MVDR, and MUSIC algorithm).
- Forward and inverse S-transform (Stockwell transform).
